- How do I handle non closed trades, now we have 2048 steps per episode, which we start at random point in a day. Then
  what will we do open positions for example model has + 2000$ pnl but havent closed it yet then episode truncates ?

- Model keeps buying at the ask and selling on the bid non-stop how do we prevent that (we do not added spread features
  yet)

- Sweep has errors when starting, fix them.
