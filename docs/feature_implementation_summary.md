# Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented all 22 missing features following Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles. All features pass their tests and follow the normalization contract (no NaN values, bounded ranges).

## Implemented Features

### High-Frequency Features (3 new, total: 9)
1. **HF Volume Velocity** (`hf_volume_velocity`)
   - Calculates rate of volume change per second
   - Normalized to [-1, 1] for ±1000% volume change
   - Handles zero volume edge cases

2. **HF Volume Acceleration** (`hf_volume_acceleration`)
   - Measures change in volume velocity
   - Requires 3 data points minimum
   - Normalized to [-1, 1] for ±500% acceleration

3. **HF Quote Imbalance** (`quote_imbalance`)
   - Calculates (bid_size - ask_size) / (bid_size + ask_size)
   - Naturally bounded to [-1, 1]
   - Aggregates all quotes in current second

### Medium-Frequency Features (14 new, total: 26)

#### Acceleration Features (4)
1. **1m Price Acceleration** (`1m_price_acceleration`)
   - Change in 1-minute price velocity
   - Normalized to [-1, 1] for ±2% acceleration

2. **5m Price Acceleration** (`5m_price_acceleration`)
   - Change in 5-minute price velocity
   - Normalized to [-1, 1] for ±5% acceleration

3. **1m Volume Acceleration** (`1m_volume_acceleration`)
   - Change in 1-minute volume velocity
   - Handles zero volume gracefully

4. **5m Volume Acceleration** (`5m_volume_acceleration`)
   - Change in 5-minute volume velocity
   - Similar logic to 1m version

#### Candle Analysis Features (6)
1. **Position in Previous Candle 1m/5m** (`1m/5m_position_in_previous_candle`)
   - Where current price sits in previous candle range
   - Already normalized to [0, 1]

2. **Upper Wick Relative 1m/5m** (`1m/5m_upper_wick_relative`)
   - Upper wick size relative to total range
   - Normalized to [0, 1]

3. **Lower Wick Relative 1m/5m** (`1m/5m_lower_wick_relative`)
   - Lower wick size relative to total range
   - Normalized to [0, 1]

#### Swing Features (4)
1. **Swing High Distance 1m/5m** (`1m/5m_swing_high_distance`)
   - Distance to nearest swing high
   - Uses local maxima detection
   - Normalized to [0, 1] where 0 = at swing

2. **Swing Low Distance 1m/5m** (`1m/5m_swing_low_distance`)
   - Distance to nearest swing low
   - Uses local minima detection
   - Normalized to [0, 1] where 0 = at swing

### Portfolio Features (5 new)
1. **Portfolio Position Size** (`portfolio_position_size`)
   - Position value as % of total equity
   - Already normalized to [0, 1]

2. **Portfolio Average Price** (`portfolio_average_price`)
   - Distance from entry price
   - Normalized to [-1, 1] for ±20% moves

3. **Portfolio Unrealized P&L** (`portfolio_unrealized_pnl`)
   - Unrealized P&L as % of equity
   - Normalized to [-1, 1] for ±10% P&L

4. **Portfolio Time in Position** (`portfolio_time_in_position`)
   - Time held normalized to 1 hour max
   - Already normalized to [0, 1]

5. **Portfolio Max Adverse Excursion** (`portfolio_max_adverse_excursion`)
   - Maximum drawdown during trade
   - Normalized to [0, 1] where 1 = 10% MAE

## Key Implementation Details

### Design Principles Followed
1. **No NaN Values**: Every feature handles missing data gracefully
2. **Proper Normalization**: All features return values in expected ranges
3. **Edge Case Handling**: Zero values, missing data, extreme moves all handled
4. **Performance**: Efficient calculations, no unnecessary loops

### Testing
- All 29 tests passing
- Edge cases thoroughly tested
- Normalization verified
- Integration tested

## Total Feature Count
- **Before**: 28 features
- **After**: 50 features (22 new)
- **Coverage**: All features from docs/features.md now implemented

## Next Steps
1. Update feature configuration to use all 50 features
2. Adjust model architecture if needed for new feature count
3. Monitor feature importance during training
4. Consider feature selection based on performance
