- **Features**: Multi-timeframe (HF/MF/LF/Static/Portfolio)

## Metric Categories & Relevance

### 1. Training Metrics ⚙️ - HIGH PRIORITY

#### ✅ Already Implemented
- `episode_reward_mean/current` - Essential for tracking learning progress
- `eval_reward_mean/length/count` - Critical for validation
- `learning_rate` - Important for optimization tracking
- `steps_per_second` - Performance monitoring

#### 🔴 Missing but ESSENTIAL
1. **PPO-Specific Metrics** (Critical for PPO debugging):
   - `explained_variance` - How well value function predicts returns
   - `approx_kl` - Policy stability monitoring
   - `clip_fraction` - PPO clipping effectiveness
   
2. **Loss Metrics** (Currently recorded but not collected):
   - `actor_loss` - Policy learning health
   - `critic_loss` - Value function learning health
   - `policy_entropy` - Exploration monitoring

**Implementation**: These are already calculated in `ppo_agent.py` but need proper collection in `training_metrics.py`.

### 2. Trading Performance Metrics 📈 - HIGH PRIORITY

#### ✅ Already Implemented (Good Coverage)
- P&L metrics: `realized_pnl`, `win_rate`, `profit_factor`
- Trade analysis: `total_trades`, `avg_trade_pnl`
- Cost metrics: `total_slippage`, `total_transaction_costs`
- Risk metrics: `max_drawdown_pct`

#### 🟡 Missing but USEFUL
1. **Sortino Ratio** - Better than Sharpe for downside-focused strategies
2. **Average Holding Time** - Critical for momentum strategy validation

**Relevance**: These metrics directly validate your momentum trading strategy effectiveness.

### 3. Model Internals & Diagnostics 🧠 - MEDIUM PRIORITY

#### 🟡 Partially Relevant
1. **Transformer Attention Weights** - Could reveal which timeframes (HF/MF/LF) the model prioritizes
2. **Action Probabilities** - Useful for debugging action selection bias
3. **Input Feature Distributions** - Important for feature engineering validation

#### 🔵 Lower Priority
- **Feature Importance (SHAP/LIME)** - Computationally expensive, better for research phase
- **Parameter Norms** - Already tracking gradient norms which is sufficient

**Implementation Consideration**: Attention visualization would be valuable but requires custom implementation for your multi-branch architecture.

### 4. Environment & Action Metrics 🌍 - HIGH PRIORITY

#### ✅ Already Implemented (Excellent Coverage)
- Action distribution: `action_hold/buy/sell_pct`
- Invalid actions: `invalid_action_rate`
- Step tracking: `total_env_steps`

#### 🟡 Missing but USEFUL
1. **Action Efficiency Metrics** - Measure action quality relative to market conditions
2. **Correlation Metrics** - Link actions to outcomes

**Relevance**: Critical for momentum trading where timing and action selection are key.

### 5. Reward Component Metrics 🏆 - CRITICAL PRIORITY

#### ✅ Partially Implemented
- Individual component tracking exists
- Basic statistics available

#### 🔴 Missing but CRITICAL
1. **Component Contribution Percentages** - Understand reward balance
2. **Component Correlations** - Validate reward engineering
3. **Reward Sparsity** - Critical for RL stability
4. **Component Volatility** - Stability analysis

**Relevance**: Your modular reward system (RewardSystemV2) needs comprehensive monitoring to ensure proper incentive alignment.
