# Optuna Hyperparameter Optimization Refactoring Summary

## Overview
The Optuna hyperparameter optimization system has been refactored to integrate with the new callback system and evaluation framework while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Key Changes

### 1. New OptunaCallback (`callbacks/optuna_callback.py`)
- Implements the new BaseCallback interface
- Listens for `on_evaluation_complete` events
- Reports evaluation metrics to Optuna trials
- Handles pruning decisions
- Supports configurable metric selection and reporting intervals

### 2. Refactored Optuna Runner (`core/optuna/optuna_runner.py`)
- Clean integration with Hydra configuration system
- Uses the new callback system via factory pattern
- Properly manages trial lifecycle and results
- Generates visualizations and study reports
- No longer depends on hardcoded imports from main.py

### 3. New Training Integration (`core/optuna/optuna_training.py`)
- Provides `run_optuna_trial()` function that bootstraps the entire application
- Integrates OptunaCallback through the callback factory
- Manages Hydra global state between trials
- Extracts metrics from evaluation results

### 4. Configuration Updates

#### Callback Configuration (`config/callbacks/callback_config.py`)
- Added `OptunaCallbackConfig` dataclass
- Integrated into main `CallbackConfig`

#### Callback Factory (`callbacks/core/factory.py`)
- Added support for creating OptunaCallback
- Accepts optional `optuna_trial` parameter

#### Optuna YAML Configs (`config/optuna/overrides/`)
- Updated all phase configs (foundation, reward, finetune) to Hydra format
- Added evaluation settings for trials
- Configured callback enables/disables for optimization
- Added `@package _global_` directive for Hydra

### 5. PyProject Commands
Updated commands to use the new runner:
```toml
optuna-foundation = "poetry run python core/optuna/optuna_runner.py --spec config/optuna/overrides/foundation.yaml"
optuna-reward = "poetry run python core/optuna/optuna_runner.py --spec config/optuna/overrides/reward.yaml"
optuna-finetune = "poetry run python core/optuna/optuna_runner.py --spec config/optuna/overrides/finetune.yaml"
optuna-dashboard = "optuna-dashboard sqlite:///optuna_studies.db"
```

## Usage

### Running Optimization
```bash
# Run foundation phase optimization
poetry run poe optuna-foundation

# Run reward system optimization
poetry run poe optuna-reward

# Run fine-tuning optimization
poetry run poe optuna-finetune

# Launch dashboard
poetry run poe optuna-dashboard
```

### Custom Studies
```python
from core.optuna.optuna_runner import OptunaRunner

# Create runner with custom spec
runner = OptunaRunner(spec_path="my_optuna_spec.yaml")

# Run all studies
runner.run_all_studies()

# Or run specific study
study_config = runner.spec.studies[0]
study = runner.run_study(study_config)
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Clean Integration**: Works seamlessly with the new callback and evaluation systems
2. **No Hardcoded Dependencies**: Removed direct imports from main.py
3. **Proper State Management**: Hydra global state is properly managed between trials
4. **Evaluation-Based Optimization**: Uses proper evaluation results, not training metrics
5. **Configurable**: All aspects configurable through YAML files
6. **Maintained Features**: All original features preserved (samplers, pruners, visualizations)

## Migration Notes

- The old `core/optuna/optimization.py` is no longer used and can be removed
- The old callback system integration is no longer needed
- Phase transition scripts are not included (as requested) - users manually update configs
- Database location changed from `sweep_studies.db` to `optuna_studies.db`

## Future Improvements

1. Add parallel trial execution support
2. Add more sophisticated metric extraction
3. Support for multi-objective optimization
4. Integration with cloud storage for distributed optimization
