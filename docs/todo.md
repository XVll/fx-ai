Our task is to re-write whole codebase from scratch. New implementation will be at /v2 directory. Rest of the codebase will be our reference.
- We will be removing references when we are done with the new implementation.
- New implementation will be done in TDD, testable and modular, maintainable.
- You won't be implementing everything at once.
  - We will talk about each module on its interface, when we are on the same page, I will approve you to write test cases.
  - When I am satisfied with the test cases, I will approve you to write the implementation.
