# MarketSimulatorV2 Test Summary

This document summarizes the comprehensive test suite created for MarketSimulatorV2, focusing on behavior and outputs rather than implementation details.

## âœ… Test Results: 32/32 PASSED

All tests are now passing and validate that MarketSimulatorV2 correctly handles all critical scenarios.

## Test Categories

### 1. Basic Functionality Tests

- **test_initialization**: Verifies simulator initializes with correct parameters
- **test_initialize_day**: Tests loading data for a trading day and building indices
- **test_accurate_timestamp_tracking**: Ensures current timestamp is accurately maintained
- **test_reset_functionality**: Verifies simulator state is properly cleared on reset

### 2. Pre-Market and Warmup Data Tests

- **test_pre_market_4am_data_handling**: Validates that 4 AM pre-market data is correctly handled
- **test_weekend_warmup_data_handling**: Tests Monday 4AM trading with weekend gaps (Friday data as lookback)
- **test_holiday_warmup_data_handling**: Validates trading after market holidays
- **test_pre_market_data_with_previous_day_context**: Tests pre-market queries with gap-up scenarios
- **test_first_trading_day_of_symbol**: Handles IPO/new symbol with no previous day data
- **test_transition_from_pre_market_to_regular_hours**: Validates smooth transition at 9:30 AM

### 3. Market State and Data Integrity Tests

- **test_market_state_with_exact_timestamp_match**: Tests O(1) lookup when timestamp exists
- **test_market_state_with_interpolation**: Validates handling of queries between data points
- **test_interpolate_state_method**: Tests interpolation logic for smooth transitions
- **test_data_consistency_across_queries**: Ensures repeated queries return identical results

### 4. Future Data Leakage Prevention Tests (Critical for RL)

- **test_no_future_data_leakage_in_market_state**: Ensures market state never includes future OHLCV
- **test_no_future_quotes_in_market_state**: Validates quotes don't leak future information
- **test_interpolation_uses_only_past_data**: Confirms interpolation only uses past/current data
- **test_future_buffer_isolation**: Verifies future buffer is isolated from state queries
- **test_execution_uses_future_data_correctly**: Confirms execution simulation properly uses future data for slippage

### 5. Trading Status and Halt Tests

- **test_halt_detection**: Validates halt status is correctly identified
- **test_halt_status_temporal_consistency**: Ensures halt status respects time boundaries
- **test_order_execution_during_halt**: Verifies orders are rejected during halts

### 6. Order Execution Simulation Tests

- **test_market_order_execution**: Tests realistic market order execution with slippage
- **test_limit_order_execution**: Validates limit order logic (marketable vs non-marketable)
- **test_latency_calculation**: Tests realistic latency based on order size and time
- **test_slippage_calculation**: Validates slippage increases with order size
- **test_market_impact_modeling**: Ensures market impact scales with order size

### 7. Edge Cases and Error Handling

- **test_edge_case_no_data**: Handles empty data gracefully
- **test_edge_case_invalid_spread**: Fixes invalid bid/ask relationships
- **test_continuous_time_progression**: Ensures time moves forward consistently

### 8. Statistics and Monitoring

- **test_execution_statistics**: Validates execution tracking and statistics
- **test_future_price_buffer**: Tests future data retrieval for execution simulation

## Key Test Scenarios Covered

### Weekend and Holiday Handling
The tests verify that the simulator works correctly when:
- Trading on Monday at 4 AM (weekend gap)
- Trading after holidays
- Previous trading day needs to be found (not just previous calendar day)

### Pre-Market Trading (4 AM - 9:30 AM)
Tests ensure:
- Sparse pre-market data is handled correctly
- Transitions to regular hours are smooth
- Volume and volatility differences are captured
- Gap-up/gap-down scenarios work properly

### Future Data Isolation
Critical tests for RL training ensure:
- State queries NEVER include future information
- Only past and current data is used for interpolation
- Future buffer is strictly isolated for execution simulation
- Temporal consistency is maintained

### Realistic Market Conditions
Tests simulate:
- Trading halts and resumptions
- Invalid/crossed spreads
- Sparse data with gaps
- IPO first-day trading
- Pre-market to regular hours transitions

## Implementation Notes

1. All tests use mock DataManager to isolate MarketSimulatorV2 behavior
2. Tests focus on inputs/outputs, not implementation details
3. Timezone-aware timestamps (US/Eastern) are used throughout
4. Both sparse and dense data scenarios are tested
5. Edge cases include no data, invalid spreads, and halt conditions

## Running the Tests

Due to import issues in the test environment, the tests can be run with:
```bash
cd /home/fx/Repositories/fx-ai
PYTHONPATH=/home/fx/Repositories/fx-ai poetry run python -m pytest tests/simulators/test_market_simulator_v2.py -v
```

Or selectively:
```bash
# Run pre-market tests
poetry run pytest tests/simulators/test_market_simulator_v2.py -k "pre_market" -v

# Run future data leakage tests
poetry run pytest tests/simulators/test_market_simulator_v2.py -k "future_data" -v

# Run weekend handling tests
poetry run pytest tests/simulators/test_market_simulator_v2.py -k "weekend" -v
```
